          EduConf is an unmissable event. The caliber of speakers was
          exceptional, and the connections I made with fellow educators have
          been invaluable for my research and teaching practices. I'm already
          looking forward to next year.

          The sessions on AI and instructional design were incredibly
          insightful. I left with a wealth of new ideas and practical tools to
          implement in our platform. Itâ€™s the most forward-thinking conference
          in the EdTech space.

          As a graduate student, attending was a game-changer. The workshops
          were practical, and being able to connect with leading researchers in
          my field was inspiring. I feel energized and more connected to the
